Any changes to these files for a specific project should be considered and likely pushed back into this
repository for future use.

### Pylint
This `.pylintrc` file should be used as the configuration for pylint on all projects.

# Pytest
This `.coveragerc` file should be used on all python projects going forward. It requires
100% test coverage. Although this number may be adjusted it is highly encouraged.
